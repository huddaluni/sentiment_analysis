# Text Classification API with FastAPI, Docker, and Hugging Face Transformers

This project implements a RESTful API using FastAPI for performing text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or emotion classification. The API utilizes a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformer model and is containerized using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

## Build and Run the Docker Container

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd text-classification-api
    ```

3. Build the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker build -t text-classification-api .
    ```

4. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name text-classification-api-container -p 8000:8000 text-classification-api
    ```

## Interacting with the API

Once the Docker container is running, you can interact with the API using HTTP requests.

### Analyze Text Endpoint

Send a POST request to the `/analyze` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the text you want to analyze:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/analyze' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "text": "Your text goes here"
}'
```

### Response

The API will return the classification result in JSON format.

## API Documentation

You can access the API documentation and test the endpoints using Swagger UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your web browser.

## Tests

Three API tests are included using FastAPIâ€™s TestClient:

1. Test sending a positive sentiment text.
2. Test sending a negative sentiment text.
3. Test sending a neutral sentiment text (if applicable).

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

## Deployment

The API can be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces or any other suitable hosting platform.
